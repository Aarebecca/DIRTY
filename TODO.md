TODO List for DIRE update
=========================

- [ ] Restructure layout so (our) data and AST API is more portable. Right now
   it's under
   `dataset-gen/decompiler/{function.py,ida_ast.py,typeinfo.py,variable.py}`,
   but it should be top-level to decouple it from data collection.

- [ ] Double-check data serialization
